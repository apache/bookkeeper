## Overview

Consider the below guidelines in preparation for upgrading.

- Always back up all your configuration files before upgrading.
- Read through the documentation and draft an upgrade plan that matches your specific requirements and environment before starting the upgrade process.
    Put differently, don't start working through the guide on a live cluster. Read guide entirely, make a plan, then execute the plan.
- Pay careful consideration to the order in which components are upgraded. In general, you need to upgrade bookies first and then upgrade your clients.
- If autorecovery is running along with bookies, you need to pay attention to the upgrade sequence.
- Read the release notes carefully for each release. They contain not only information about noteworthy features, but also changes to configurations
    that may impact your upgrade.
- Always upgrade one or a small set of bookies to canary new version before upgraing all bookies in your cluster.

## Canary

It is wise to canary an upgraded version in one or small set of bookies before upgrading all bookies in your live cluster.

You can follow below steps on how to canary a upgraded version:

1. Stop a Bookie.
2. Upgrade the binary and configuration.
3. Start the Bookie in `ReadOnly` mode. This can be used to verify if the Bookie of this new version can run well for read workload.
4. Once the Bookie is running at `ReadOnly` mode successfully for a while, restart the Bookie in `Write/Read` mode.
5. After step 4, the Bookie will serve both write and read traffic.

### Rollback Canaries

If problems occur during canarying an upgraded version, you can simply take down the problematic Bookie node. The remain bookies in the old cluster
will repair this problematic bookie node by autorecovery. Nothing needs to be worried about.

## Upgrade Steps

Once you determined a version is safe to upgrade in a few nodes in your cluster, you can perform following steps to upgrade all bookies in your cluster.

1. Determine if autorecovery is running along with bookies. If yes, check if the clients (either new clients with new binary or old clients with new configurations)
are allowed to talk to old bookies; if clients are not allowed to talk to old bookies, please [disable autorecovery](../reference/cli/#autorecovery-1) during upgrade.
2. Decide on performing a rolling upgrade or a downtime upgrade.
3. Upgrade all Bookies (more below)
4. If autorecovery was disabled during upgrade, [enable autorecovery](../reference/cli/#autorecovery-1).
5. After all bookies are upgraded, build applications that use `BookKeeper client` against the new bookkeeper libraries and deploy the new versions.

### Upgrade Bookies

In a rolling upgrade scenario, upgrade one Bookie at a time. In a downtime upgrade scenario, take the entire cluster down, upgrade each Bookie, then start the cluster.

For each Bookie:

1. Stop the bookie.
2. Upgrade the software (either new binary or new configuration)
2. Start the bookie.

## Upgrade Guides

We describe the general upgrade method in Apache BookKeeper as above. We will cover the details for individual versions.

### 4.8.x to 4.9.x upgrade

In 4.9.x some significant updates have been made to handle the ledger metadata to enhance data consistency and access
efficiency. Consequently, the current journal format version has been upgraded to 6, and the FileInfo header version has
been upgraded to 1. However, since the default configuration values of 'journalFormatVersionToWrite' and '
fileInfoFormatVersionToWrite' are set to older versions, this feature is off by default. To enable this feature, those
config values should be set to the current versions. Once this is enabled, you cannot roll back to previous Bookie
versions (4.8.x and older), as the older version code would not be able to deal with the explicitLac entry in the
Journal file while replaying the journal and reading the header of Index files / FileInfo would fail reading Index files
with the newer FileInfo version. So, in summary, it is a non-rollbackable feature, and it applies even if explicitLac is
not in used.

|--------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| numIoThreads | 2 * Runtime.getRunTime().availableProcessed | configures the number of IO threads for client |

### 4.7.x to 4.8.x upgrade

In 4.8.x a new feature is added to persist explicitLac in FileInfo and explicitLac entry in Journal. (Note: Currently
this feature is not available if your ledgerStorageClass is DbLedgerStorage, ISSUE #1533 is going to address it) Hence
current journal format version is bumped to 6 and current FileInfo header version is bumped to 1. But since default
config values of 'journalFormatVersionToWrite' and 'fileInfoFormatVersionToWrite' are set to older versions, this
feature is off by default. To enable this feature those config values should be set to current versions. Once this is
enabled then we cannot rollback to previous Bookie versions (4.7.x and older), since older version code would not be
able to deal with explicitLac entry in Journal file while replaying journal and also reading Header of Index files /
FileInfo would fail reading Index files with newer FileInfo version. So in summary, it is a non-rollbackable feature and
it applies even if explicitLac is not being used.

### 4.6.x to 4.7.x upgrade

There isn't any protocol related backward compabilities changes in 4.7.0. So you can follow the general upgrade sequence to upgrade from 4.6.x to 4.7.0.

### 4.5.x to 4.6.x upgrade

There isn't any protocol related backward compabilities changes in 4.6.x. So you can follow the general upgrade sequence to upgrade from 4.5.x to 4.6.x.

### 4.4.x to 4.5.x upgrade

There isn't any protocol related backward compabilities changes in 4.5.0. So you can follow the general upgrade sequence to upgrade from 4.4.x to 4.5.x.
However, we list a list of things that you might want to know.

1. 4.5.x upgrades netty from 3.x to 4.x. The memory usage pattern might be changed a bit. Netty 4 uses more direct memory. Please pay attention to your memory usage
    and adjust the JVM settings accordingly.
2. `multi journals` is a non-rollbackable feature. If you configure a bookie to use multiple journals on 4.5.x you can not roll the bookie back to use 4.4.x. You have
    to take a bookie out and recover it if you want to rollback to 4.4.x.

If you are planning to upgrade a non-secured cluster to a secured cluster enabling security features in 4.5.0, please read [BookKeeper Security](../security/overview) for more details.
