### Breaking Changes

* `BookieServer` API changed and the code that creates its instances will require addition
  of the `UncleanShutdownDetection` parameter.
  See [PR 2936](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/pull/2936) for details and examples.

* `Bookie` class now is an interface with implementation in `BookieImpl`.
  Code that uses it may need changes.
  For details please refer to [PR 2717](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/pull/2717).

* `LedgerUnderreplicationManager` interface added a new method.
  Code that implements the interface will need changes.
  See [PR 2805](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/pull/2805) for details.

* `MetadataBookieDriver` interface added a new method and removed an old one.
  `RegistrationManager` interface added a new method.
  `ByteBufAllocatorWithOomHandler` interface is added and used instead of
  the `ByteBufAllocator` in multiple places.
  Code that implements the interfaces will need changes.
  See [PR 2901](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/pull/2901) for details.

* RocksDB configuration moves to the independent configuration files.
  We used to place the RocksDB configuration properties in the `bk_server.conf`. Now it moved to the independent files
  `entry_location_rocksdb.conf` and `ledger_metadata_rocksdb.conf`. 
  The existing configuration in the `bk_server.conf` for the RocksDB will invalidate.
  See [PR 3056](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/pull/3056) for details.

### Highlights

#### Configuration

* [ledgerMetadataVersion](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/pull/2708):
  BookKeeper-Client config to write ledger metadata with configured version.
* [clientTcpUserTimeoutMillis](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/pull/2761):
  Added TCP_USER_TIMEOUT to Epoll channel config.
* [auditorMaxNumberOfConcurrentOpenLedgerOperations and auditorAcquireConcurrentOpenLedgerOperationsTimeOutMSec](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/pull/2802)
  Add auditor get ledger throttle to avoid auto recovery zk session.
* [dbStorage_rocksDB_format_version](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/pull/2824)
  make rocksdb format version configurable.

#### Features

* Running without journal. See [BP-46](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/pull/2706) for details.
* A REST API to get or update bookie readOnly state. [Details](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/pull/2799)
* Separate config files for Rocks DB. [Details](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/pull/3056/)

#### Bugs

- [https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/pull/2740] Fix Bouncy Castle fips incompatible issue

  In #2631, the default BouncyCastle was changed from non-fips into fips version. But the default version of BouncyCastle in Pulsar is the non-fips one(aimed to make it compatible with the old version of Pulsar).

  Bouncy Castle provides both FIPS and non-FIPS versions, but in a JVM, it can not include both of the 2 versions(non-Fips and Fips), and we have to exclude the current version before including the other. This makes the backward compatible a little hard, and that's why Pulsar has to involve an individual module for Bouncy Castle.

- [https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/pull/2762] Upgrade libthrift to 0.14.2 to address multiple CVEs

  The current libthrift version 0.12.0 has multiple vulnerabilities: CVE-2019-0205 , CVE-2019-0210 , CVE-2020-13949

- [https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/pull/2735] Exclude grpc-okhttp dependency

  The okhttp dependency version 2.7.4 is old and vulnerable. This dependency isn't needed and it causes Bookkeeper to be flagged for security vulnerabilities.

- [https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/pull/2734] Upgrade Freebuilder version and fix the dependency

  - Freebuilder 1.14.9 contains an outdate jquery js file which causes the library to be flagged as vulnerable with the highest threat level in Sonatype IQ vulnerability scanner. This also flags Bookkeeper as vulnerable with the highest threat level although it is a false positive and not an actual threat.

  - Freebuilder shouldn't be exposed as a transitive dependency
    - it's an annotation processor which should be defined
      - [optional in maven](https://github.com/inferred/FreeBuilder#maven)
      - [compileOnly in gradle](https://github.com/inferred/FreeBuilder#gradle)

- [https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/pull/2693] Upgrade vertx to 4.3.2, addresses CVE-2018-12541

  The current vertx version is 3.5.3 which has a vulnerability, CVE-2018-12541 .

## 4.8.0

This is the 13th release of Apache BookKeeper!

The 4.8.0 release incorporates hundreds of bug fixes, improvements, and features since previous major release, 4.7.0.
It is a new big milestone in Apache BookKeeper community,
this release include great new features, like Relaxed Durability, Stream Storage service and Multiple active Entrylogs.

Apache BookKeeper/DistributedLog users are encouraged to [upgrade to 4.8.0](docs/admin/upgrade). The technical details of
this release are summarized below.

### Highlights

The main features in 4.8.0 are around following areas:

- Durability
- ExplicitLAC feature
- New Table Storage Service
- Bug Fixes


#### New WriteFlag DEFERRED_SYNC

The writer may ask for temporary relaxed durability writes, that is to receive early acknowledge from Bookies, before an fsync() on Journal.
Together with this new flag we introduced the new WriteHandle#force() API, this this API the writer is able to request an explicit guarantee of durability to the Bookies
it is mostly like and explicit fsync() on a file system.

See [`DEFERRED_SYNC`]({{ site.javadoc_base_url }}/javadoc/org/apache/bookkeeper/client/api/WriteFlag) and [force()]({{ site.javadoc_base_url }}/javadoc/org/apache/bookkeeper/client/api/ForceableHandle) for reference

#### New behaviour for Netty ByteBuf reference count management

All the client side APIs which take ByteBufs now will have the net effect of decrementing by 1 the refcount.
This is consistent with general contract of Netty.
It is expected that the client passes the ownership of the ByteBuf to BookKeeper client.

#### Multiple Active Entrylogs

It is now possible on the Bookie to have multiple active entry loggers,
this new feature will help with compaction performance and some specific workloads.

See [Multiple active entrylogs](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/issues/570)

#### Table Storage Service

From this version we are providing the a table (key/value) service embedded in Bookies.
 
See [BP-30: BookKeeper Table Service](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/issues/1205)

#### Make ExplicitLAC persistent

ExplicitLAC was contributed from Salesforce in 4.5.0 release, but in the first release
it was a beft-effort in-memory mechanism. Now you can configure Bookies to store durably ExplicitLAC.

See [Make ExplicitLAC persistent](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/issues/1527)

#### Ensemble change on Delayed Write Failure

We are handling more gracefully the case of a failure of a Bookie in spite of a succeeded write.
If you are writing with Ack Quorum = 2 and Write Quorum = 3, writes will succeeed even if 1 of 3 Bookies fail,
now BookKeeper will trigger an *ensemble change* and replace the failed bookie earlier.

See [Ensemble change on Delayed Write Failure](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/issues/1390)

## 4.7.0

This is the tenth release of Apache BookKeeper!

The 4.7.0 release incorporates hundreds of bug fixes, improvements, and features since previous major release, 4.6.0,
which was released four months ago. It is a big milestone in Apache BookKeeper community - Yahoo branch is fully merged
back to upstream, and Apache Pulsar (incubating) starts using official BookKeeper release for its upcoming 2.0 release.

It is also the first release of Apache DistributedLog after it is merged as sub modules of Apache BookKeeper.

Apache BookKeeper/DistributedLog users are encouraged to [upgrade to 4.7.0](docs/admin/upgrade). The technical details of
this release are summarized below.

### Highlights

The main features in 4.7.0 cover are around following areas:

- Dependencies Changes
- Public API
- Security
- DbLedgerStorage
- Metadata API
- Performance
- Operations
- Builds & Testing
- Bug Fixes

#### Dependencies Changes

Here is a list of dependencies changed in 4.7.0:

- [JCommander](http://jcommander.org/) 1.48 is added as a dependency of bookkeeper-server module.
- [RocksDB](http://rocksdb.org/) 5.8.6 is introduced as part of `DbLedgerStorage` as a dependency of bookkeeper-server module.
- [DataSketches](https://datasketches.github.io/) 0.8.3 is introduced as a dependency of prometheus-metrics-provider module.
- Upgrade [Guava](https://github.com/google/guava) from `20.0` to `21.0`.

#### Public API

There are multiple new client features introduced in 4.7.0. Here are two highlighted features:

##### Fluent API

The new fluent style APi is evolving in 4.7.0. All the methods in handlers are now having both async and sync methods.
See [#1288](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/pull/1288) for more details

##### CRC32C

`circe-checksum` module is ported from Apache Pulsar to Apache BookKeeper, and CRC32C digest type is added as one digest type option.
The JNI based CRC32C in `circe-checksum` module provides excellent performance than existing CRC32 digest type. Users are encouraged
to start use CRC32C digest type.

#### Security

- New PEM format `X.509` certificates are introduced for TLS authentication. See [#965](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/pull/965) for more details.
- TLS related settings are converged into same settings as bookie server. See [Upgrade Guide](docs/admin/upgrade) for more details.

#### DbLedgerStorage

`DbLedgerStorage` is a new ledger storage that introduced by Yahoo and now fully merged into Apache BookKeeper. It is fully compatible for both v2 and v3
protocols and also support long polling. It uses [RocksDB](http://rocksdb.org/) to store ledger index, which eliminates the needed of ledger index files and
reduces the number of open file descriptors and the amount of random IOs can occurs during flushing ledger index.

#### Metadata API

New serviceUri based metadata API is introduced as [BP-29](http://bookkeeper.apache.org/bps/BP-29-metadata-store-api-module). This metadata API provides the metadata
abstraction over ledger manager, registration service, allowing plugin different type of data stores as the metadata service.

#### Performance

There are a lot for performance related bug fixes and improvements in 4.7.0. Some of the changes are highlighted as below:

- Leverage netty object recycler to reduce object allocations
- A bunch of contentions around locking are removed. E.g. [#1321](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/pull/1321) [#1292](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/pull/1292) [#1258](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/pull/1258)
- Introduce priority thread pool for accepting high priority reads/writes. This allows high priority reads/writes such as ledger recovery operations can
  succeed even bookies are overwhelmed. [#898](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/pull/898)
- Reorder slow bookies in read sequence. [#883](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/pull/883)
- Use atomic field updater and long adder to replace AtomicInteger/AtomicLong/AtomicReference in Dlog. [#1299](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/pull/1299)
- DataSketches library is used for implementing prometheus provider. [#1245](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/pull/1245)

#### Operations

#### BookieShell

There are are multiple new commands are added in BookieShell. Here are a few highlighted:

- `metaformat` is deprecated with two new commands `initnewcluster` and `nukeexistingcluster`. This separation provides better operability and reduces mistakes.
- `initbookie` command is introduced for initializing a new bookie. `bookieformat` keeps serving as the purpose of reformatting a bookie.

A new BookKeeper CLI is proposed in [BP-27](http://bookkeeper.apache.org/bps/BP-27-new-bookkeeper-cli). Some commands are already ported to new bookkeeper CLI.
The full list of shell commands will be fully ported to new bookkeeper CLI in next release.

#### ReadOnly Mode Support

Operations are improved around readonly mode for handling bookkeeper outage situation. New settings are introduce allow entry log creation, high priority writes
even when bookies are readonly. See [Upgrade Guide](docs/admin/upgrade) to learn all newly added settings.


#### Builds & Testing

- [Arquillian](http://arquillian.org/) framework is introduced in 4.7.0 for backward compatibility and integration tests. 
- Both Java8 and Java9 are now supported for running bookkeeper.

## 4.6.0

This is the seventh release of BookKeeper as an Apache Top Level Project!

The 4.6.0 release incorporates new fixes, improvements, and features since previous major release 4.5.0.

Apache BookKeeper users are encouraged to upgrade to 4.6.0. The technical details of this release are summarized
below.

### Highlights

The main features in 4.6.0 cover are around following areas:
- Dependencies Upgrade
- Bookie enhancement
- BookKeeper Admin REST API
- New BookKeeper API
- Performance improvement
- Deployment or Ease of use 

#### Dependencies Upgrade

- Upgrade Protobuf to `3.4`.

#### Bookie enhancement

- Persistable bookie status.
  - Prior to this release, bookie status was transient. It is a bit hard for management tooling. This feature adds persistable bookies status. See [Issue-265](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/issues/265) for more details.

- Introduce Bookie Discovery Interface.  Prior to this release, bookkeeper client only provides interfaces for ledger metadata management. It doesn't provide any interface for service discovery part. This feature introduces bookie discovery interface, so it allows plugging in different service discovery backends for bookkeeper.
  - Introduce Bookie Registration Manager for bookie server, see [Issue-662](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/issues/662) for more details.
  - Introduce registration client for bookkeeper client, see [Issue-666](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/issues/666) for more details.

- Lifecycle components for managing components in bookie server.
  - Introduce lifecycle component for each service component, which includes "stats provider", "auto recovery", "http endpoint", and "bookie server(both storage and netty server)", to run these components in a clear way. See [Issue-508](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/issues/508) and [Issue-547](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/issues/547) for more details.

- Make bookie recovery work with recovering multiple bookies. 
  - Make recovery tool work with multiple bookies, so that one call could recover multiple bookies. See [Issue-612](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/issues/612) for more details.

#### BookKeeper Admin REST API

- Introduce a bookkeeper admin endpoint for operations to interact and administer the bookkeeper cluster using REST API. see [PR-278](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/pull/278), [Issue-520](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/issues/520), and [Issue-674](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/issues/674) for more details.

#### New BookKeeper API

- New Fluent Style API.
  - A brand new API to manage ledgers using the Builder pattern, and new interfaces to make it clear operations on ledgers, like WriteHandle and ReadHandle, are provided in this release. See [Issue-506](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/issues/506), [Issue-673](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/issues/673) and [Issue-550](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/issues/550) for more details

#### Performance improvement
- Use ByteBuf in multiple places to avoid unnecessary memory allocation and reduce the garbage produced in JVM. See [PR-640](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/pull/640) for more details.

- Separate the FileInfo cache into write and read cache. It avoids catchup reads impact tailing reads and writes. See [PR-513](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/pull/513) for more details.

#### Deployment or Ease of use
- Deployment BookKeeper on K8s. 
  - Provide yaml files to run BookKeeper on Kubernetes using both StatefulSets and DaemonSet. See [Issue-337](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/issues/337) and [Issue-681](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/issues/681)for more details.

### Existing API changes

- BookKeeper constructor now throws BKException instead of KeeperException.
- The signatures of `reorderReadSequence` and `reorderReadLACSequence` are changed in EnsemblePlacementPolicy.

## 4.5.0

This is the fifth release of BookKeeper as an Apache Top Level Project!

The 4.5.0 release incorporates hundreds of new fixes, improvements, and features since previous major release, 4.4.0,
which was released over a year ago. It is a big milestone in Apache BookKeeper community, converging from three
main branches (Salesforce, Twitter and Yahoo).

Apache BookKeeper users are encouraged to upgrade to 4.5.0. The technical details of this release are summarized
below.

### Highlights

The main features in 4.5.0 cover are around following areas:

- Dependencies Upgrade
- Security
- Public API
- Performance
- Operations

#### Dependencies Upgrade

Here is a list of dependencies upgraded in 4.5.0:

- Moved the developement from Java 7 to Java 8.
- Upgrade Protobuf to `2.6`.
- Upgrade ZooKeeper from `3.4` to `3.5`.
- Upgrade Netty to `4.1`.
- Upgrade Guava to `20.0`.
- Upgrade SLF4J to `1.7.25`.
- Upgrade Codahale to `3.1.0`.

#### Security

Prior to this release, Apache BookKeeper only supports simple `DIGEST-MD5` type authentication.

With this release of Apache BookKeeper, a number of feature are introduced that can be used, together of separately,
to secure a BookKeeper cluster.

The following security features are currently supported.

- Authentication of connections to bookies from clients, using either `TLS` or `SASL (Kerberos).
- Authentication of connections from clients, bookies, autorecovery daemons to `ZooKeeper`, when using zookeeper
    based ledger managers.
- Encryption of data transferred between bookies and clients, between bookies and autorecovery daemons using `TLS`.

It's worth noting that those security features are optional - non-secured clusters are supported, as well as a mix
of authenticated, unauthenticated, encrypted and non-encrypted clients.

For more details, have a look at [BookKeeper Security](docs/security/overview).

#### Public API

There are multiple new client features introduced in 4.5.0.

##### LedgerHandleAdv

The [Ledger API] is the low level API provides by BookKeeper for interacting with `ledgers` in a bookkeeper cluster.
It is simple but not flexible on ledger id or entry id generation. Apache BookKeeper introduces `LedgerHandleAdv`
as an extension of existing `LedgerHandle` for advanced usage. The new `LedgerHandleAdv` allows applications providing
its own `ledger-id` and assigning `entry-id` on adding entries.

See [Ledger Advanced API](docs/api/ledger-adv-api) for more details.

##### Long Poll

`Long Poll` is a main feature that [DistributedLog](https://distributedlog.io) uses to achieve low-latency tailing.
This big feature has been merged back in 4.5.0 and available to BookKeeper users.

This feature includes two main changes, one is `LastAddConfirmed` piggyback, while the other one is a new `long poll` read API.

The first change piggyback the latest `LastAddConfirm` along with the read response, so your `LastAddConfirmed` will be automatically advanced
when your read traffic continues. It significantly reduces the traffic to explicitly polling `LastAddConfirmed` and hence reduces the end-to-end latency.

The second change provides a new `long poll` read API, allowing tailing-reads without polling `LastAddConfirmed` everytime after readers exhaust known entries.
Although `long poll` API brings great latency improvements on tailing reads, it is still a very low-level primitive.
It is still recommended to use high level API (e.g. [DistributedLog API](docs/api/distributedlog-api)) for tailing and streaming use cases.

See [Streaming Reads](https://bookkeeper.apache.org/docs/next/api/distributedlog-api) for more details.

##### Explicit LAC

Prior to 4.5.0, the `LAC` is only advanced when subsequent entries are added. If there is no subsequent entries added,
the last entry written will not be visible to readers until the ledger is closed. High-level client (e.g. DistributedLog) or applications
has to work around this by writing some sort of `control records` to advance `LAC`.

In 4.5.0, a new `explicit lac` feature is introduced to periodically advance `LAC` if there are not subsequent entries added. This feature
can be enabled by setting `explicitLacInterval` to a positive value.

#### Performance

There are a lot for performance related bug fixes and improvements in 4.5.0. These changes includes:

- Upgraded netty from 3.x to 4.x to leverage buffer pooling and reduce memory copies.
- Moved developement from Java 7 to Java 8 to take advantage of Java 8 features.
- A lot of improvements around scheduling and threading on `bookies`.
- Delay ensemble change to improve tail latency.
- Parallel ledger recovery to improve the recovery speed.
- ...

We outlined following four changes as below. For a complete list of performance improvements, please checkout the `full list of changes` at the end.

##### Netty 4 Upgrade

The major performance improvement introduced in 4.5.0, is upgrading netty from 3.x to [4.x](http://netty.io/wiki/new-and-noteworthy-in-4.0.html).

For more details, please read [upgrade guide](docs/admin/upgrade) about the netty related tips when upgrading bookkeeper from 4.4.0 to 4.5.0.

##### Delay Ensemble Change

`Ensemble Change` is a feature that Apache BookKeeper uses to achieve high availability. However it is an expensive metadata operation.
Especially when Apache BookKeeper is deployed in a multiple data-centers environment, losing a data center will cause churn of metadata
operations due to ensemble changes. `Delay Ensemble Change` is introduced in 4.5.0 to overcome this problem. Enabling this feature means
an `Ensemble Change` will only occur when clients can't receive enough valid responses to satisfy `ack-quorum` constraint. This feature
improves the tail latency.

To enable this feature, please set `delayEnsembleChange` to `true` on your clients.

##### Parallel Ledger Recovery

BookKeeper clients recovers entries one-by-one during ledger recovery. If a ledger has very large volumn of traffic, it will have
large number of entries to recover when client failures occur. BookKeeper introduces `parallel ledger recovery` in 4.5.0 to allow
batch recovery to improve ledger recovery speed.

To enable this feature, please set `enableParallelRecoveryRead` to `true` on your clients. You can also set `recoveryReadBatchSize`
to control the batch size of recovery read.

##### Multiple Journals

Prior to 4.5.0, bookies are only allowed to configure one journal device. If you want to have high write bandwidth, you can raid multiple
disks into one device and mount that device for jouranl directory. However because there is only one journal thread, this approach doesn't
actually improve the write bandwidth.

BookKeeper introduces multiple journal directories support in 4.5.0. Users can configure multiple devices for journal directories.

To enable this feature, please use `journalDirectories` rather than `journalDirectory`.

#### Operations

##### LongHierarchicalLedgerManager

Apache BookKeeper supports pluggable metadata store. By default, it uses Apache ZooKeeper as its metadata store. Among the zookeeper-based
ledger manager implementations, `HierarchicalLedgerManager` is the most popular and widely adopted ledger manager. However it has a major
limitation, which it assumes `ledger-id` is a 32-bits integer. It limits the number of ledgers to `2^32`.

`LongHierarchicalLedgerManager` is introduced to overcome this limitation.

See [Ledger Manager](docs/getting-started/concepts#ledger-manager) for more details.

##### Weight-based placement policy

`Rack-Aware` and `Region-Aware` placement polices are the two available placement policies in BookKeeper client. It places ensembles based
on users' configured network topology. However they both assume that all nodes are equal. `weight-based` placement is introduced in 4.5.0 to
improve the existing placement polices. `weight-based` placement was not built as separated polices. It is built in the existing placement policies.
If you are using `Rack-Aware` or `Region-Aware`, you can simply enable `weight-based` placement by setting `diskWeightBasedPlacementEnabled` to `true`.

##### Customized Ledger Metadata

A `Map<String, byte[]>` is introduced in ledger metadata in 4.5.0. Clients now are allowed to pass in a key/value map when creating ledgers.
This customized ledger metadata can be later on used by user defined placement policy. This extends the flexibility of bookkeeper API.

##### Add Prometheus stats provider

A new [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) [stats provider](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/tree/master/bookkeeper-stats-providers/prometheus-metrics-provider)
is introduce in 4.5.0. It simplies the metric collection when running bookkeeper on [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).

##### Add more tools in BookieShell

`BookieShell` is the tool provided by Apache BooKeeper to operate clusters. There are multiple importants tools introduced in 4.5.0, for example, `decommissionbookie`,
`expandstorage`, `lostbookierecoverydelay`, `triggeraudit`.

For the complete list of commands in `BookieShell`, please read [BookKeeper CLI tool reference](docs/reference/cli).
