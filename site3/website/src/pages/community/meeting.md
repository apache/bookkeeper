# Community meetings

The community meeting runs bi-weekly on Thursday 8am - 9am PST.

The meeting is typically comprised of 3 parts:

- Discuss [BookKeeper Proposals](https://bookkeeper.apache.org/community/bookkeeper-proposals/).
- Review and address concerns for any open pull requests.
- Open discussion.

As a member of the BookKeeper community, you are welcome to join any of the meetings if you are interested in. No registration required.
