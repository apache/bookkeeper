title: BookKeeper on IRC
---

Although Apache BookKeeper doesn't have a dedicated IRC channel, there is a **#zookeeper** channel on irc.freenode.org where the BookKeeper developers often hang out.

The IRC channel can be used for online discussion about ZooKeeper-related matters, but developers should be careful to transfer all the official decisions or useful discussions to the [issue tracking system](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BOOKKEEPER).
