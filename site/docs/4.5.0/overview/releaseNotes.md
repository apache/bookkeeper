title: Apache BookKeeper 4.5.0 Release Notes
---

This is the fifth release of BookKeeper as an Apache Top Level Project!

The 4.5.0 release incorporates hundreds of new fixes, improvements, and features since previous major release, 4.4.0,
which was released over a year ago. It is a big milestone in Apache BookKeeper community, converging from three
main branches (Salesforce, Twitter and Yahoo).

Apache BookKeeper users are encouraged to upgrade to 4.5.0. The technical details of this release are summarized
below.

## Highlights

The main features in 4.5.0 cover are around following areas:

- Dependencies Upgrade
- Security
- Public API
- Performance
- Operations

### Dependencies Upgrade

Here is a list of dependencies upgraded in 4.5.0:

- Moved the developement from Java 7 to Java 8.
- Upgrade Protobuf to `2.6`.
- Upgrade ZooKeeper from `3.4` to `3.5`.
- Upgrade Netty to `4.1`.
- Upgrade Guava to `20.0`.
- Upgrade SLF4J to `1.7.25`.
- Upgrade Codahale to `3.1.0`.

### Security

Prior to this release, Apache BookKeeper only supports simple `DIGEST-MD5` type authentication.

With this release of Apache BookKeeper, a number of feature are introduced that can be used, together of separately,
to secure a BookKeeper cluster.

The following security features are currently supported.

- Authentication of connections to bookies from clients, using either `TLS` or `SASL (Kerberos).
- Authentication of connections from clients, bookies, autorecovery daemons to `ZooKeeper`, when using zookeeper
    based ledger managers.
- Encryption of data transferred between bookies and clients, between bookies and autorecovery daemons using `TLS`.

It's worth noting that those security features are optional - non-secured clusters are supported, as well as a mix
of authenticated, unauthenticated, encrypted and non-encrypted clients.

For more details, have a look at [BookKeeper Security](../../security/overview).

### Public API

There are multiple new client features introduced in 4.5.0.

#### LedgerHandleAdv

The [Ledger API] is the low level API provides by BookKeeper for interacting with `ledgers` in a bookkeeper cluster.
It is simple but not flexible on ledger id or entry id generation. Apache BookKeeper introduces `LedgerHandleAdv`
as an extension of existing `LedgerHandle` for advanced usage. The new `LedgerHandleAdv` allows applications providing
its own `ledger-id` and assigning `entry-id` on adding entries.

See [Ledger Advanced API](../../api/ledger-adv-api) for more details.

#### Long Poll

`Long Poll` is a main feature that [DistributedLog](https://distributedlog.io) uses to achieve low-latency tailing.
This big feature has been merged back in 4.5.0 and available to BookKeeper users.

This feature includes two main changes, one is `LastAddConfirmed` piggyback, while the other one is a new `long poll` read API.

The first change piggyback the latest `LastAddConfirm` along with the read response, so your `LastAddConfirmed` will be automatically advanced
when your read traffic continues. It significantly reduces the traffic to explicitly polling `LastAddConfirmed` and hence reduces the end-to-end latency.

The second change provides a new `long poll` read API, allowing tailing-reads without polling `LastAddConfirmed` everytime after readers exhaust known entries.
Although `long poll` API brings great latency improvements on tailing reads, it is still a very low-level primitive.
It is still recommended to use high level API (e.g. [DistributedLog API](../../api/distributedlog-api)) for tailing and streaming use cases.

See [Streaming Reads](https://distributedlog.incubator.apache.org/docs/latest/user_guide/design/main.html#streaming-reads) for more details.

#### Explicit LAC

Prior to 4.5.0, the `LAC` is only advanced when subsequent entries are added. If there is no subsequent entries added,
the last entry written will not be visible to readers until the ledger is closed. High-level client (e.g. DistributedLog) or applications
has to work around this by writing some sort of `control records` to advance `LAC`.

In 4.5.0, a new `explicit lac` feature is introduced to periodically advance `LAC` if there are not subsequent entries added. This feature
can be enabled by setting `explicitLacInterval` to a positive value.

### Performance

There are a lot for performance related bug fixes and improvements in 4.5.0. These changes includes:

- Upgraded netty from 3.x to 4.x to leverage buffer pooling and reduce memory copies.
- Moved developement from Java 7 to Java 8 to take advantage of Java 8 features.
- A lot of improvements around scheduling and threading on `bookies`.
- Delay ensemble change to improve tail latency.
- Parallel ledger recovery to improve the recovery speed.
- ...

We outlined following four changes as below. For a complete list of performance improvements, please checkout the `full list of changes` at the end.

#### Netty 4 Upgrade

The major performance improvement introduced in 4.5.0, is upgrading netty from 3.x to [4.x](http://netty.io/wiki/new-and-noteworthy-in-4.0.html).

For more details, please read [upgrade guide](../../admin/upgrade) about the netty related tips when upgrading bookkeeper from 4.4.0 to 4.5.0.

#### Delay Ensemble Change

`Ensemble Change` is a feature that Apache BookKeeper uses to achieve high availability. However it is an expensive metadata operation.
Especially when Apache BookKeeper is deployed in a multiple data-centers environment, losing a data center will cause churn of metadata
operations due to ensemble changes. `Delay Ensemble Change` is introduced in 4.5.0 to overcome this problem. Enabling this feature means
an `Ensemble Change` will only occur when clients can't receive enough valid responses to satisfy `ack-quorum` constraint. This feature
improves the tail latency.

To enable this feature, please set `delayEnsembleChange` to `true` on your clients.

#### Parallel Ledger Recovery

BookKeeper clients recovers entries one-by-one during ledger recovery. If a ledger has very large volumn of traffic, it will have
large number of entries to recover when client failures occur. BookKeeper introduces `parallel ledger recovery` in 4.5.0 to allow
batch recovery to improve ledger recovery speed.

To enable this feature, please set `enableParallelRecoveryRead` to `true` on your clients. You can also set `recoveryReadBatchSize`
to control the batch size of recovery read.

#### Multiple Journals

Prior to 4.5.0, bookies are only allowed to configure one journal device. If you want to have high write bandwidth, you can raid multiple
disks into one device and mount that device for jouranl directory. However because there is only one journal thread, this approach doesn't
actually improve the write bandwidth.

BookKeeper introduces multiple journal directories support in 4.5.0. Users can configure multiple devices for journal directories.

To enable this feature, please use `journalDirectories` rather than `journalDirectory`.

### Operations

#### LongHierarchicalLedgerManager

Apache BookKeeper supports pluggable metadata store. By default, it uses Apache ZooKeeper as its metadata store. Among the zookeeper-based
ledger manager implementations, `HierarchicalLedgerManager` is the most popular and widely adopted ledger manager. However it has a major
limitation, which it assumes `ledger-id` is a 32-bits integer. It limits the number of ledgers to `2^32`.

`LongHierarchicalLedgerManager` is introduced to overcome this limitation.

See [Ledger Manager](../../getting-started/concepts/#ledger-manager) for more details.

#### Weight-based placement policy

`Rack-Aware` and `Region-Aware` placement polices are the two available placement policies in BookKeeper client. It places ensembles based
on users' configured network topology. However they both assume that all nodes are equal. `weight-based` placement is introduced in 4.5.0 to
improve the existing placement polices. `weight-based` placement was not built as separated polices. It is built in the existing placement policies.
If you are using `Rack-Aware` or `Region-Aware`, you can simply enable `weight-based` placement by setting `diskWeightBasedPlacementEnabled` to `true`.

#### Customized Ledger Metadata

A `Map<String, byte[]>` is introduced in ledger metadata in 4.5.0. Clients now are allowed to pass in a key/value map when creating ledgers.
This customized ledger metadata can be later on used by user defined placement policy. This extends the flexibility of bookkeeper API.

#### Add Prometheus stats provider

A new [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) [stats provider](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/tree/master/bookkeeper-stats-providers/prometheus-metrics-provider)
is introduce in 4.5.0. It simplies the metric collection when running bookkeeper on [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).

#### Add more tools in BookieShell

`BookieShell` is the tool provided by Apache BooKeeper to operate clusters. There are multiple importants tools introduced in 4.5.0, for example, `decommissionbookie`,
`expandstorage`, `lostbookierecoverydelay`, `triggeraudit`.

For the complete list of commands in `BookieShell`, please read [BookKeeper CLI tool reference](../../reference/cli).
