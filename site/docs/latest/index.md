This documentation is for Apache BookKeeper version `{{ site.latest_version }}`.

Apache BookKeeper is a scalable, fault tolerant and low latency storage service optimized for realtime workloads.
It offers `durability`, `replication` and `strong consistency` as essentials for building reliable real-time applications.

It is suitable for being used in following scenerios:

- [WAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write-ahead_logging) (Write-Ahead-Logging), e.g. HDFS [namenode](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.5.2/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HDFSHighAvailabilityWithNFS.html#BookKeeper_as_a_Shared_storage_EXPERIMENTAL).
- Message Store, e.g. [Apache Pulsar](https://pulsar.incubator.apache.org/).
