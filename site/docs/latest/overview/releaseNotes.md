### Existing API changes

- The default ledger manager factory is changed from FlatLedgerManagerFactory to HierarchicalLedgerManagerFactory if `ledgerManagerFactoryClass`
  is specified. If you have a cluster running with older versions and no `ledgerManagerFactoryClass` is set before, you need to set
  `ledgerManagerFactoryClass` explicitly to `org.apache.bookkeeper.meta.FlatLedgerManagerFactory` in your bookie configuration before upgrade.
