title: Manual deployment
---

The easiest way to deploy BookKeeper is using schedulers like [DC/OS](../dcos), but you can also deploy BookKeeper clusters manually. A BookKeeper cluster consists of two main components:

* A [ZooKeeper](#zookeeper-setup) cluster that is used for configuration- and coordination-related tasks
* An [ensemble](#starting-up-bookies) of {% pop bookies %}

## ZooKeeper setup

We won't provide a full guide to setting up a ZooKeeper cluster here. We recommend that you consult [this guide](https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/current/zookeeperAdmin.html) in the official ZooKeeper documentation.

## Starting up bookies

Once your ZooKeeper cluster is up and running, you can start up as many {% pop bookies %} as you'd like to form a cluster. Before starting up each bookie, you need to modify the bookie's configuration to make sure that it points to the right ZooKeeper cluster.

On each bookie host, you need to [download](../../getting-started/installation#download) the BookKeeper package as a tarball. Once you've done that, you need to configure the bookie by setting values in the `bookkeeper-server/conf/bk_server.conf` config file. The one parameter that you will absolutely need to change is the [`zkServers`](../../config#zkServers) parameter, which you will need to set to the ZooKeeper connection string for your ZooKeeper cluster. Here's an example:

```properties
zkServers=100.0.0.1:2181,100.0.0.2:2181,100.0.0.3:2181
```

> A full listing of configurable parameters available in `bookkeeper-server/conf/bk_server.conf` can be found in the [Configuration](../../reference/config) reference manual.

Once the bookie's configuration is set, you can start it up using the [`bookie`](../../reference/cli#bookkeeper-bookie) command of the [`bookkeeper`](../../reference/cli#bookkeeper) CLI tool:

```shell
$ bookkeeper-server/bin/bookkeeper bookie
```

> You can also build BookKeeper [by cloning it from source](../../getting-started/installation#clone) or [using Maven](../../getting-started/installation#build-using-maven).

### System requirements

{% include system-requirements.md %}

## Cluster metadata setup

Once you've started up a cluster of bookies, you need to set up cluster metadata for the cluster by running the following command from any bookie in the cluster:

```shell
$ bookkeeper-server/bin/bookkeeper shell metaformat
```

You can run in the formatting 

> The `metaformat` command performs all the necessary ZooKeeper cluster metadata tasks and thus only needs to be run *once* and from *any* bookie in the BookKeeper cluster.

Once cluster metadata formatting has been completed, your BookKeeper cluster is ready to go!
