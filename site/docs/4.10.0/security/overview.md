title: BookKeeper Security
next: ../tls
---

In the 4.5.0 release, the BookKeeper community added a number of features that can be used, together or separately, to secure a BookKeeper cluster.
The following security measures are currently supported:

1. Authentication of connections to bookies from clients, using either [TLS](../tls) or [SASL (Kerberos)](../sasl).
2. Authentication of connections from clients, bookies, autorecovery daemons to [ZooKeeper](../zookeeper), when using zookeeper based ledger managers.
3. Encryption of data transferred between bookies and clients, between bookies and autorecovery daemons using [TLS](../tls).

Itâ€™s worth noting that security is optional - non-secured clusters are supported, as well as a mix of authenticated, unauthenticated, encrypted and non-encrypted clients.

NOTE: authorization is not yet available in 4.5.0. The Apache BookKeeper community is looking to add this feature in subsequent releases.

## Next Steps

- [Encryption and Authentication using TLS](../tls)
- [Authentication using SASL](../sasl)
- [ZooKeeper Authentication](../zookeeper)
