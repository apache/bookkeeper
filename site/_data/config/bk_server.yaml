    default: 3181
  - param: journalDirectories
    description: |
      The directories to which Bookkeeper outputs its write-ahead log (WAL).  Could define multi directories to store write head logs, separated by ','.
      For example:
        journalDirectories=/tmp/bk-journal1,/tmp/bk-journal2
      If journalDirectories is set, bookies will skip journalDirectory and use this setting directory.
    default: /tmp/bk-journal
  - param: journalDirectory
    description: The directory to which Bookkeeper outputs its write-ahead log (WAL).
    default: /tmp/bk-txn
  - param: allowMultipleDirsUnderSameDiskPartition
    description: Configure the bookie to allow/disallow multiple ledger/index/journal directories in the same filesystem disk partition
    default: false

  - param: listeningInterface
    description: The network interface that the bookie should listen on. If not set, the bookie will listen on all interfaces.
    default: eth0
  - param: advertisedAddress
    description: |
      Configure a specific hostname or IP address that the bookie should use to advertise itself to
      clients. If not set, bookie will advertised its own IP address or hostname, depending on the
      `listeningInterface` and `useHostNameAsBookieID` settings.
    default: eth0
  - param: allowLoopback
    description: |
      Whether the bookie is allowed to use a loopback interface as its primary
      interface (the interface it uses to establish its identity). By default, loopback interfaces are *not* allowed as the primary interface.

      Using a loopback interface as the primary interface usually indicates a configuration error. It's fairly common in some VPS setups, for example, to not configure a hostname or to have the hostname resolve to 127.0.0.1. If this is the case, then all bookies in the cluster will establish their identities as 127.0.0.1:3181, and only one will be able to join the cluster. For VPSs configured like this, you should explicitly set the listening interface.
    default: 'false'
  - param: bookieDeathWatchInterval
    description: Interval to watch whether bookie is dead or not, in milliseconds.
    default: 1000
  - param: flushInterval
    description: When entryLogPerLedgerEnabled is enabled, checkpoint doesn't happens when a new active entrylog is created / previous one is rolled over. Instead SyncThread checkpoints periodically with 'flushInterval' delay (in milliseconds) in between executions. Checkpoint flushes both ledger entryLogs and ledger index pages to disk.  Flushing entrylog and index files will introduce much random disk I/O. If separating journal dir and ledger dirs each on different devices, flushing would not affect performance. But if putting journal dir and ledger dirs on same device, performance degrade significantly on too frequent flushing. You can consider increment flush interval to get better performance, but you need to pay more time on bookie server restart after failure. This config is used only when entryLogPerLedgerEnabled is enabled.

  - param: allowEphemeralPorts
    description: Whether the bookie is allowed to use an ephemeral port (port 0) as its server port. By default, an ephemeral port is not allowed.

    description: How long the interval to trigger next garbage collection of overreplicated ledgers, in milliseconds. This should not be run very frequently since we read the metadata for all the ledgers on the bookie from zk.
    default: 86400000
  - param: isForceGCAllowWhenNoSpace
    description: Whether force compaction is allowed when the disk is full or almost full. Forcing GC may get some space back, but may also fill up disk space more quickly. This is because new log files are created before GC, while old garbage log files are deleted after GC.

In general, incrementing pageLimit, using smaller index page would gain bettern performance in lager number of ledgers with fewer entries case.
