    default: 3181
  - param: allowMultipleDirsUnderSameDiskPartition
    description: Configure the bookie to allow/disallow multiple ledger/index/journal directories in the same filesystem disk partition
    default: false
  - param: listeningInterface
    description: The network interface that the bookie should listen on. If not set, the bookie will listen on all interfaces.
    default: eth0
  - param: advertisedAddress
    description: |
      Configure a specific hostname or IP address that the bookie should use to advertise itself to
      clients. If not set, bookie will advertised its own IP address or hostname, depending on the
      `listeningInterface` and `useHostNameAsBookieID` settings.
    default: eth0
  - param: allowLoopback
    description: |
      Whether the bookie is allowed to use a loopback interface as its primary
      interface (the interface it uses to establish its identity). By default, loopback interfaces are *not* allowed as the primary interface.

      Using a loopback interface as the primary interface usually indicates a configuration error. It's fairly common in some VPS setups, for example, to not configure a hostname or to have the hostname resolve to 127.0.0.1. If this is the case, then all bookies in the cluster will establish their identities as 127.0.0.1:3181, and only one will be able to join the cluster. For VPSs configured like this, you should explicitly set the listening interface.

       5: expanding header to 512 and padding writes to align sector size configured by `journalAlignmentSize`

      By default, it is `6`.
      If you'd like to disable persisting ExplicitLac, you can set this config to < `6` and also fileInfoFormatVersionToWrite should be set to 0. If there is mismatch then the serverconfig is considered invalid.
      You can disable `padding-writes` by setting journal version back to `4`. This feature is available in 4.5.0 and onward versions.

      By default, data sync is enabled to guarantee durability of writes. Beware - when disabling data sync in the bookie journal
      might improve the bookie write performance, it will also introduce the possibility of data loss. With no fsync, the journal
      entries are written in the OS page cache but not flushed to disk. In case of power failure, the affected bookie might lose
      the unflushed data. If the ledger is replicated to multiple bookies, the chances of data loss are reduced though still present.

  - param: minUsableSizeForEntryLogCreation
    description: |
      Minimum safe usable size to be available in ledger directory for bookie to create entry log files (in bytes).
      This parameter allows creating entry log files when there are enough disk spaces, even when
      the bookie is running at readonly mode because of the disk usage is exceeding `diskUsageThreshold`.
      Because compaction, journal replays can still write data to disks when a bookie is readonly.

      Minimum safe usable size to be available in ledger directory for bookie to accept high priority writes even it is in readonly mode.
    default: 1.2 * `logSizeLimit`
  - param: flushInterval
    description: When entryLogPerLedgerEnabled is enabled, checkpoint doesn't happens when a new active entrylog is created / previous one is rolled over. Instead SyncThread checkpoints periodically with 'flushInterval' delay (in milliseconds) in between executions. Checkpoint flushes both ledger entryLogs and ledger index pages to disk.  Flushing entrylog and index files will introduce much random disk I/O. If separating journal dir and ledger dirs each on different devices, flushing would not affect performance. But if putting journal dir and ledger dirs on same device, performance degrade significantly on too frequent flushing. You can consider increment flush interval to get better performance, but you need to pay more time on bookie server restart after failure. This config is used only when entryLogPerLedgerEnabled is enabled.

    default: 3600
  - param: compactionMaxOutstandingRequests
    description: Set the maximum number of entries which can be compacted without flushing. When compacting, the entries are written to the entrylog and the new offsets are cached in memory. Once the entrylog is flushed the index is updated with the new offsets. This parameter controls the number of entries added to the entrylog before a flush is forced. A higher value for this parameter means  more memory will be used for offsets. Each offset consists of 3 longs. This parameter should *not* be modified unless you know what you're doing.

A larger index page can improve performance writing page to disk, which is efficent when you have small number of ledgers and these ledgers have similar number of entries. If you have large number of ledgers and each ledger has fewer entries, smaller index page would improve memory usage.

    description: |
      How many index pages provided in ledger cache. If number of index pages reaches this limitation, bookie server starts to swap some ledgers from memory to disk. You can increment this value when you found swap became more frequent. But make sure pageLimit*pageSize should not more than JVM max memory limitation, otherwise you would got OutOfMemoryException. In general, incrementing pageLimit, using smaller index page would gain bettern performance in lager number of ledgers with fewer entries case.

      The time interval, in seconds, at which the auditor will check all ledgers in the cluster. By default this runs once a week.

- name: Memory allocator settings
  params:
  - param: allocatorPoolingPolicy
    description: |
      Define the memory pooling policy.

      Available options are:
        - PooledDirect: Use Direct memory for all buffers and pool the memory.
                        Direct memory will avoid the overhead of JVM GC and most
                        memory copies when reading and writing to socket channel.
                        Pooling will add memory space overhead due to the fact that
                        there will be fragmentation in the allocator and that threads
                        will keep a portion of memory as thread-local to avoid
                        contention when possible.
        - UnpooledHeap: Allocate memory from JVM heap without any pooling.
                        This option has the least overhead in terms of memory usage
                        since the memory will be automatically reclaimed by the
                        JVM GC but might impose a performance penalty at high
                        throughput.
    default: PooledDirect
  - param: allocatorPoolingConcurrency
    description: |
      Controls the amount of concurrency for the memory pool.
      Default is to have a number of allocator arenas equals to 2 * CPUS.
      Decreasing this number will reduce the amount of memory overhead, at the
      expense of increased allocation contention.
    default: 2 * CPUS
  - param: allocatorOutOfMemoryPolicy
    description: |
      Define the memory allocator out of memory policy.

      Available options are:
        - FallbackToHeap: If it's not possible to allocate a buffer from direct memory,
                          fallback to allocate an unpooled buffer from JVM heap.
                          This will help absorb memory allocation spikes because the heap
                          allocations will naturally slow down the process and will result
                          if full GC cleanup if the Heap itself is full.
        - ThrowException: Throw regular OOM exception without taking addition actions.
    default: FallbackToHeap
  - param: allocatorLeakDetectionPolicy
    description: |
      Define the memory allocator leak detection policy.

      Available options are:
        - Disabled: No leak detection and no overhead.
        - Simple: Instruments 1% of the allocated buffer to track for leaks.
        - Advanced: Instruments 1% of the allocated buffer to track for leaks, reporting
                    stack traces of places where the buffer was used.
        - Paranoid: Instruments 100% of the allocated buffer to track for leaks, reporting
                    stack traces of places where the buffer was used. Introduce very
                    significant overhead.
    default: Disabled
